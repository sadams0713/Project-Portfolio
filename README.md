# Project-Portfolio
Resume Repo

First and foremost, let me explain.

If you've landed here it means I submitted an application to your company. You're valid if you're feeling annoyed that this isn't full of code and demos. In fact, this entire repo is being created hastily due to the fact that after submitting multiple applications, I've come to the realization that everything I've designed, built, tested, created, all of the things that I've so proudly touted in my resume are all in private repos because most of them are internal tools developed for my company. At the risk of being passed over for a position, I'm choosing to keep those repos private **for now**. At some point when I get some spare time, I will go over each and every project with a fine-tooth comb to scrub any and all potentially sensitive information from each and every one of these projects, clear out the history and open the codebase for everyone. Today however... is not that day, and if you've landed here prior to that day I don't want you to leave empty handed. So in the meantime, THIS is my MVP. 

This repo serves as my Project Portfolio â€” a central hub where I walk through what Iâ€™ve built, why I built it, the problems I solved, and how I approached each one. Youâ€™ll find:

ðŸ“„ PDF summaries of major systems (PO System, Quote System, Final Inspection, etc.)
ðŸŽ¥ Video walkthroughs of each of the systems mentioned in my resume (These are coming soon, but I wanted to put it in writing so I'm pot committed to doing them)
ðŸ§  Design insights and real-world problem solving

My goal here is to give you a window into how I think, how I solve problems, and how I build things that make peopleâ€™s lives easier.

If you haven't been totally turned away in disappointment, frustration, and anger at this point but you're still not satisfied with what you've seen, please contact me with specific code you would like to see, projects you'd like me to elaborate on or demo in realtime, or anything else I can do to regain the favor that you've no doubt lost some of by this point. Once again, my apologies. Thanks for hanging in there with me.
